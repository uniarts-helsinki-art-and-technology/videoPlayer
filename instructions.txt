How to insert video on the Raspberry Pi
***************************************
Put the video file on a USB drive. There should be no other files on the drive. The file should not be inside a folder. (Hidden files and folders are ok. If there are many files, the first one is used, in alphanumeric order.)
Connect the USB drive to the Raspberry Pi and turn the Raspberry Pi on.
The video is copied on the SD card of the Raspberry Pi and starts playing.
The USB drive can be removed after this. Turn power off before removing the drive though. (It is unmounted using umount but just to be sure)
The video will play automatically when the Raspberry Pi is started. (Before that it will search for a USB drive 10 times. A drive can be inserted and it will load a video.)
To insert another video, repeat the same process. The previous video will be deleted.


Notes
*****
Any file on the drive will be loaded, whether or not it is a valid video file. If the player fails, make sure the right file was loaded!
Preferred format for video is: 
	H.264 High 1920x1080 60fps
